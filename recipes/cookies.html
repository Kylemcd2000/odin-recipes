    <h2>Method</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Begin with browning 1 cup of butter in a pan on low heat. 
            <strong>Take creamie not to burn the butter 
            as this will bitter the cookies</strong> once browned place in
            fridge, ideally overnight or until butter has cooled and resolidified
        </li>
        <li>Cream the browned butter with 1 1/2 cup light brown sugar
            and 1/2 cup of white sugar, as this comes together add two cold
            eggs to the mixture and mix till homogonous.
            <strong>Cold eggs will give the cookies a more desireable texture</strong>
        </li>
        <li>In a seperate bowl for the dry ingredients add 11 1/2 oz of AP flour, 
            a Tbs Kosher Salt, a 1/2 tsp Baking Soda and 3/4 tsp cinnamon
            then whisk together.
        </li>
        <li>In batches to prevent over mixing, slowly add the dry ingredient
            in with the wet ingredients and mix just before the desired cookie
            dough texture is reached
        </li>
        <li>Roughly chop up high quality chocolate orange into varying pieces
            and add to the cookie dough then mix till thorougly combined adding
            the desire cookie dough texture is reached
            <strong>make sure not to over mix as this will activate the gluten
                in the flour resulting in a tough cookie
            </strong>
        </li> 
        <li>Ideally, place the cookie dough in the fridge overnight
            to cool the cookie dough.
            <strong>cold cookie dough holds its shape and height preventing
                flat and hard texture
            </strong>
        </li>
        <li>Once cooled, take decent sized amount of cookie dough and roll
            into a rough ball, taking care not to heat the dough up too much.
            Tear the ball of dough to create a rustic look and texture, then place 
            onto a baking tray
        </li>
        <li>
            Place cookies into a preheated oven at 180 degrees celsius
            for about 12-17 minutes. Once cooked remove from oven and let rest until
            cooled.
            <strong>The cookies will toughen a little as they cool, so they
                may seem a little more soft straight out the oven.
            </strong>
