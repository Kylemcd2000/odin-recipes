        <ol class="list">
            
            <li>In a pan add a decent amount of water and generously salt the water.
                bring the water to a boil and add about 40g of spaghetti, stirring occassionally
                to prevent sticking
            </li>
    
            <li>While the pasta cooks, heat up 1/2tbs of olive oil in a frying pan on medium heat.
                Once the oil is hot add 3 sliced cloves of garlic and a tsp of chilli flakes
                to the oil and fry for 30s to 1 minute. 
                <strong>(No longer than 1 minute as garlic can burn very fast)</strong>
            </li>
       
            <li>
                Remove the garlic and chilli flakes from the heat and add chopped parsley
                stirring and allowing the parsley to cook from the residual heat
            </li>
    
            <li>
                Ideally, add the cooked pasta immediately to the pan after step 3 along 
                with about a 1/2 cup of pasta and stir on high heat till the water reduces
                <strong>(Adding more water and cooking on high heat will make a thicker, creamier
                    and richer sauce. feel free to experiment to your liking)</strong>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                After the sauce is to your desired consistency
                add salt, pepper, and lemon to taste.
                <strong>(Experiment with the quantities indiviudally here
                    as this will help develop understanding the balancing between
                    the ingredients, and how acid can overcome the heavy richness
                    of the fatty-oil based sauce)
                </strong>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                serve on desire dish and feel free to add a little
                bit of grated parmasean although optional
            </li>
